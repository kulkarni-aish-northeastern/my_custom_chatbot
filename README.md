# my_custom_chatbot

Created a custom chatbot web application to make job search faster by using my personal dataset from LinkedIn, enhancing its value as a personalized assistant. 
To bring this project to life, I used the Langchain framework, along with Uvicorn and FastAPI for the backend, and React for the frontend.
